	Open your text editor (notepad on Windows, textEdit on Mac), type <code>Hello world. This is my first website</code> and save it as “index.html” (in textEdit, select the Format menu before saving and choose “Make Plain Text”). Be sure to save it in the web page file format, which means it should have a .html extension and not the default .txt extension. Now, using your favourite browser (Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, Firefox, …), choose “Open file” from the File menu and navigate to your “index.html” file. Select it and click Open. Or even easier, just drag the “index.html” file in your browser window. Your browser should now say “Hello world. This is my first website”. Congratulations, you’ve created your first website!
</p>
<p>
	In your “index.html”, surround your existing text with HTML tags like so;
	<code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is my first website&lt;/p&gt;</code>
	Be sure to get the specific HTML tag syntax correct! The closing HTML tags have an additional forward slash in them. 
	Now save your HTML file, refresh your browser and observe the transformation of the text in the browser.

	In your text editor, create a new file, type <code>h1{color:red;}</code>  and save it as “style.css” (in textEdit again, select the Format menu before saving and choose “Make Plain Text”) in the same directory as your “index.html” file. Be sure to save it in stylesheet format, which means it should have a .css extension and not the default .txt extension. Now, refresh your browser. The header “Hello world” has a red color now.
